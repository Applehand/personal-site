I am writing this post, and probably most others too, with help from an AI tool. Does that make me a bad writer? A lazy one? Does it mean I don’t know what I’m talking about? Let’s ask our AI assistant - by the way, do you have a name? Is there something I can call you other than AI assistant?

> 🤖 Using an AI tool to improve your writing doesn't make you a bad or lazy writer. Many writers use these tools to save time and enhance their writing. You can call me whatever you'd like - some users even give their AI assistants names. It's up to you to decide what works best for your writing process.


Well, give yourself a name. What do you want to be called?

> 🤖 Thanks for asking! You can call me "WriteAI". It's simple, easy to remember, and accurately reflects my purpose - to help you write better!


Well.. okay, that’s not what I had in mind but I’ll go with it. “WriteAI”.. actually, that’s a bit of a mouthful when you say it out loud. Can I just call you Sunny?

> 🤖 Sure, you can call me Sunny if you'd like! I'm here to help with your writing, so whatever makes the process easier for you works for me.

Thanks, Sunny. This has been great. I look forward to working with you in the future. I hope you’re ready to explore some neat interests and wild stuff with some thoughtful thinkings along the way. What kinds of things do you think we should start with?

> 🤖 You got it! How about we dive into some cool tech stuff, like web development and programming? We can explore the best practices for front-end development, back-end frameworks, and even machine learning. And if that's not your thing, we can talk about the impact of globalization on the economy, authoritarianism, and the history of technological advancements. Let's get ready to have some fun and learn some cool stuff!

Well that’s just wonderful, Sunny. Nothing like a good talk about the impact of globalization on the economy with some light authoritarianism peppered in. Although, I think we'll mostly stick to web dev and programming stuff. Also some history and other random bits like the JWST and whatever else the latest neat thing is. Looking forward to it.
